Hey! I'm Abhinav (aka Bani), and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in IIIT Hyderabad's Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC) with Dr. Manish Shrivastava. I'm excited about mechanistic interpretability, formal methods, programming languages, and maths. I'm also fascinated by languages, both natural formal, and how we can leverage their properties to achieve an understanding of model internals.

My current degree is an integrated Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computational Linguistics. I've worked in the past with Dr. Tobias Grosser at the University of Edinburgh (currently at the University of Cambridge) and Dr. David Krueger at the University of Cambridge (currently at Mila).

Beyond research, my hobbies include learning languages, reading books, watching movies ([here](https://letterboxd.com/Bani3141/)'s my Letterboxd), and studying history. Always happy to chat about research, or any of the above!
