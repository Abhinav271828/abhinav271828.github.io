I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the Discrete Structures course, which was meant to provide freshers with a grounding in basic abstract algebra and logic. This entailed setting and evaluating homework assignments and conducting refresher classes and clarification sessions.

The following topics were covered:

* Set theory, permutations and combinations
* Logic, proof methods, mathematical induction
* Cardinality of sets, Cantor's argument
* Group theory, ring theory
* Coding theory, error correction
* Recurrences, generating functions
