I worked as a Head Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to NLP course, which was an introduction to the theory and implementation of NLP models (both classical and neural). I coordinated a team of six TAs, who worked to evaluate homework assignments, examinations and projects; conduct vivas; and teach the mathematical foundation of the broad concepts covered in the classroom.

The following topics were covered:

* Basic NLP tasks (language modelling, POS tagging, chunking)
* Bayesian methods for NLP ($n$-gram models and smoothing)
* Word embeddings; embedding spaces and geometry (SVD)
* Basics of deep learning (gradient ascent, feedforward models); neural embeddings
* Recurrent models (RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs)
* Transformers and LLMs
