Worked with Arjun Pitchanathan and [Dr. Tobias Grosser](https://grosser.science) to implement in MLIR an algorithm to count lattice points in polyhedra, with applications in polyhedral compilation, as part of the [FPL library](https://grosser.science/FPL/)

The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Abhinav271828/mlir-barvinok); upstreaming to the LLVM/MLIR project is in progress.
